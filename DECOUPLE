What files do you need to send along for only the views to compile? This list must include the
interfaces and implementations for the view itself.
- CollageView
- CollageViewImpl
- CollageGuiView
- CollageGuiViewImpl
- Features

For each file, briefly explain why that file is necessary for the view to work.
- CollageView: Necessary because it is the interface that represents the text-based view
- CollageViewImpl: Necessary because it is the implementation of the text-based view
- CollageGuiView: Necessary because it is the interface that represents the graphical user interface
view
- CollageGuiViewImpl: Necessary because it is the implementation of the graphical user interface
- Features: Necessary because the Features interface is used to handle action events from the
graphical user interface, where the GUI has action listeners for GUI components that run functions
in the Features interface.
