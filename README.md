# Collage Program

## Part 1:

### Main:
Collage class: Contains the main method where the program is started.

---

### Model:
**Pixel class:** Represents a 4-component RGBA value composed of integers representing the red, green,
and alpha channels of a pixel. 

**Image class:** The model's representation of an image made of a 2D array of Pixels. 

**Layer class:** Represents a layer in a Collage Project. A layer has a name to identify it, a 2D array
of Pixels, and a filter option to specify image processing operations done to its Pixel array when 
saving as an image or displaying an Image representation in the view. By default, a non-background
Layer will be white/transparent, with all Pixel values being (255, 255, 255, 0).

**Project class:** Represents a project in a Collage program. A Project is composed of a collection
of layers, and contain methods for manipulating them. By default, Projects always have at least
one white background Layer. 

**CollageModel interface:** An interface representing the core model for a Collage program, 
which defines the methods for creating and managing projects, layers, and images. A CollageModel 
contains methods for manipulation of a Collage program's projects and layers, as well as file 
storage and retrieval for projects and images.

**CollageModelImpl class:** A class implementing the CollageModel interface, which handles the 
actual image processing tasks, including loading and saving projects, managing layers, and applying
filters to images.

### Controller:
**CollageController interface:** An interface representing the controller for a Collage program, 
defining the method for processing user input and executing commands.

**CollageControllerImpl class:** A class implementing the CollageController interface, which reads
user input and executes the corresponding commands. The class contains a run method that manages
the application's main loop and a knownCommands map that stores available commands.

**CollageCommand interface:** An interface representing commands for the image processing 
application, defining methods for running the command on the model and retrieving a message
associated with the command.

Various command classes implementing the CollageCommand interface, such as AddImageToLayer, 
AddLayer, LoadProject, NewProject, Quit, SaveImage, SaveProject, and SetFilter.

### View:
**CollageView interface:** An interface representing the view for image processing, which defines 
the method for rendering messages to the user.

**CollageViewImpl class:** A class implementing the CollageView interface, which displays messages 
to the user via the Appendable object.
